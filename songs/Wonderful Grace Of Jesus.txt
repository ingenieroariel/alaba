Wonderful Grace Of Jesus

Wonderful, the matchless grace of Jesus.
Deeper than the mighty rolling sea.
Higher than the mountains
Sparkling like a fountain,
All sufficient grace for even me.
Broader than the scope
Of my transgressions.
Greater far than all my sin and shame.
O, magnify the precious name of Jesus!
Praise His name! 

Wonderful grace of Jesus,
Greater than all my sin.
How shall my tongue describe it?
Where shall its praise begin?
Taking away my burden,
Setting my Spirit free.
For wonderful grace of Jesus reaches me. 

Wonderful grace of Jesus,
Reaching to all the lost.
By it I have been pardoned,
Saved to the uttermost.
Chains have been torn asunder,
Giving me liberty.
For the wonderful grace
Of Jesus reaches me. 

Wonderful grace of Jesus,
Reaching the most defiled.
By its transforming power
Making Him God's dear child.
Purchasing peace and heaven
For all eternity.
And the wonderful grace
Of Jesus reaches me.
