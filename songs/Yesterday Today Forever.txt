Yesterday Today Forever

Yesterday, today, forever,
Jesus is the same.
All may change but Jesus never!
Glory to His name!
Glory to His name!
Glory to His name!
All may change but Jesus never!
Glory to His name! 

Oh how sweet the glorious message
Simple faith may claim:
Yesterday, today, forever,
Jesus is the same!
Still He loves to save the sinful,
Heal the sick and lame,
Cheer the mourner,
Still the tempest.
Glory to His name! 

He who pardoned erring Peter,
Never need'st thou fear;
He that came to faithless Thomas
All thy doubt will clear.
He who let the loved disciple,
On His bosom rest
Bids thee still,
With love as tender,
Leaning upon His breast. 

He who mid the raging billows
Walked upon the sea
Still can hush our wildest tempest,
As on Galilee.
He who wept and prayed in anguish,
In Gethsemane,
Drinks with us each cup of trembling,
In our agony. 

As of old He walked to Emmaus,
With them to abide,
So through all life's way He walketh,
Ever near our side.
Soon again shall we behold Him.
Hasten, Lord, the day!
But 'twill still be "this same Jesus,"
As He went away. 

He who was the friend of sinners,
Seeks thee, lost one, now;
Sinner, come and at His footstool
Penitently bow.
He who said, "I'll not condemn thee,
Go and sin no more;"
Speaks to thee that word of pardon,
as in days of yore. 

Oft on earth He healed the suff'rer
By His mighty hand;
Still our sicknesses and sorrows
Go at His command.
He who gave His healing virtue,
To a woman's touch;
To the faith that claims His fullness,
Still will give as much.
