I Have Settled The Question

I have settled the question,
Hallelujah!
I will never turn back
From the narrow way.
I am going thro' with Jesus,
Hallelujah!
'Til I reach the gates
Of glory some sweet day. 

I remember when the Lord
Spoke to my soul.
I could feel the heavy burden
From me roll.
When He spoke the gracious words,
"Wilt Thou be whole?"
Then I settled the question forever. 

I no longer walk the ways
Of sinfulness,
But I daily tread
The paths of righteousness.
Since the day the Lord
Has come to my life to bless.
I have settled the question forever. 

I will choose the holy joys
That always last.
And reject sin's pleasures,
That will soon be past.
To the treasures of true worth,
I'm holding fast.
I have settled the question forever. 

Others may deny the Lord
And live in sin.
But the race that I have entered
I must win.
Thro' the pearly gates,
I mean to enter in.
I have settled the question forever.
