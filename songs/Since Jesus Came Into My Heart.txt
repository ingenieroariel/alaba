Since Jesus Came Into My Heart

Since Jesus came into my heart,
Since Jesus came into my heart,
Floods of joy o'er my soul
Like the sea billows roll,
Since Jesus came into my heart. 

What a wonderful change
In my life has been wrought
Since Jesus came into my heart!
I have light in my soul,
For which long I have sought,
Since Jesus came into my heart. 

I have ceased from my
Wandering and going astray
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And my sins which were many
Are all washed away,
Since Jesus came into my heart. 

There's a light in the
Valley of death now for me,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And the gates of the city
Beyond I can see,
Since Jesus came into my heart. 

I shall go there to dwell
In that city I know,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And I'm happy, so happy,
As onward I go,
Since Jesus came into my heart. 

I'm possessed of a hope
That is steadfast and sure,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And no dark clouds of doubt
Now my pathway obscure,
Since Jesus came into my heart.
