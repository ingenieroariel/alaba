O Happy Day

Happy day, happy day,
When Jesus washed my sins away!
He taught me how to watch and pray,
And live rejoicing every day. 

O happy day that fixed my choice
On Thee, my Savior and my God!
Well may this glowing heart rejoice,
And tell its raptures all abroad. 

Tis done, the great transaction's done;
I am my Lord's and He is mine.
He drew me and I followed on,
Charmed to confess the voice divine. 

Now rest, my long divided heart;
Fixed on this blissful center; rest;
Nor ever from my Lord depart,
With Him of every good possessed. 

O happy bond that seals my vows
To Him who merits all my love!
Let cheerful anthems fill His house,
While to that sacred shrine I move. 

High heaven, that heard the solemn vow,
That vow renewed shall daily hear,
Till in life's latest hour I bow
And bless in death a bond so dear.
