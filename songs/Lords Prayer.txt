Lord's Prayer

Our Father who art in Heaven,
Hallowed by Thy name.
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,
On earth as it is in heaven. 

Give us this day our daily bread;
And forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those
Who trespass against us. 

And lead us not into temptation,
But deliver from evil,
For thine is the kingdom,
And the power and the glory forever.
Amen.
