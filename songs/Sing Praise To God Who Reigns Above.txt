Sing Praise To God Who Reigns Above

Sing praise to God who reigns above,
The God of all creation;
The God of pow'r the God of love,
The God of our salvation.
With healing balm my soul He fills,
And ev'ry faithless murmur still;
To God, all praise and glory. 

What God's almighty pow'r hath made,
His gracious mercy keepeth;
By morning glow or evening shade,
His watchful eye ne'er sleepeth.
Within the kingdom of His might,
Lo, all is just and all is right;
To God, all praise and glory. 

The Lord is never far away,
But, thru all grief distressing,
And everpresent help and stay,
Our peace and joy and blessing.
As with a mother's tender hand,
He leads His own, His chosen band,
To God, all praise and glory. 

Thus all my toilsome way along,
I sing aloud His praises;
That men may hear the grateful song.
My voice unwearied raises,
Be joyful in the Lord my heart;
Both soul and body bear your part,
To God all praise and glory.
