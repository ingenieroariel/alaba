What A Wonderful Savior

What a wonderful Savior,
Is Jesus my Jesus!
What a wonderful Savior,
Is Jesus my Lord! 

Christ has for sin atonement made;
What a wonderful Savior!
We are redeemed, the price is paid;
What a wonderful Savior! 

I praise Him for the cleansing blood;
What a wonderful Savior!
That reconciled my soul to God;
What a wonderful Savior! 

He cleansed my heart from all its sin;
What a wonderful Savior!
And now He reigns and rules therein;
What a wonderful Savior! 

He gives me overcoming power;
What a wonderful Savior!
And triumph in each trying hour;
What a wonderful Savior! 

To Him I've given all my heart;
What a wonderful Savior!
The world shall never share a part;
What a wonderful Savior! 

He walks beside me in the way;
What a wonderful Savior!
And keeps me faithful day by day;
What a wonderful Savior!
