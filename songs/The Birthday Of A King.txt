The Birthday Of A King

Alleluia! O how the angels sang!
Alleluia! How it rang!
And the sky was bright with a holy light,
'Twas the birthday of a King. 

In the little village of Bethlehem,
There lay a Child one day;
And the sky was bright with a holy light,
O'er the place where Jesus lay. 

'Twas a humble birthplace,
But oh, how much God gave to us that day;
From the manger bed what a path has led,
What a perfect holy way.

Alleluia! Alleluia!
'Twas the birthday of a King.
