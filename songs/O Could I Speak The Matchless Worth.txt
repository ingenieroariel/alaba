O Could I Speak The Matchless Worth

O could I speak the matchless worth,
O could I sound the glories forth,
Which in my Savior shine?
I'd sing His glorious righteousness
And magnify the wondrous grace
Which made salvation mine;
Which made salvation mine. 

I'd sing the precious blood He spilt,
My ransom from the dreadful guilt
Of sin, and wrath divine;
I'd sing His glorious righteousness,
In which all perfect, heavenly dress,
My soul shall ever shine;
My soul shall ever shine. 

I'd sing the characters He bears
And all the forms of love He wears,
Exalted on His throne;
In loftiest songs of sweetest praise,
I would to everlasting days,
Make all His glories known;
Make all His glories known. 

Soon the delightful day will come,
When my dear Lord will bring me home
And I shall see His face;
Then with my Savior brother friend,
A blest eternity I'll spend,
Triumphant in His grace;
Triumphant in His grace.
Amen.
