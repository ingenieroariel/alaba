I Know Whom I Have Believed

But "I know whom I have believed,
And am persuaded that He is able
To keep that which I've committed,
Unto Him against that day." 

I know not why God's wondrous grace
To me He hath made known;
Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love
Redeemed me for His own. 

I know not how this saving faith
To me He did impart,
Nor how believing in His word
Wrought peace within my heart. 

I know not how the Spirit moves,
Convincing men of sin,
Revealing Jesus through the Word,
Creating faith in Him. 

I know not what of good or ill
May be reserved for me.
Of weary ways or golden days,
Before His face I see. 

I know not when my Lord may come,
At night or noonday fair,
Nor if I'll walk the vale with Him,
Or meet Him in the air.
