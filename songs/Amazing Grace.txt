Amazing Grace

Amazing grace how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me;
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I see. 

T'was grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed. 

Through many dangers, toil and snares,
I have already come;
'Tis grace has brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home. 

When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we've first begun.
