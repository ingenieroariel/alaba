The First Noel

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel. 

The first Noel,
The angel did say,
Was to certain poor shepherds,
In fields as they lay;
In fields where they
Lay keeping their sheep,
On a cold winter's night
That was so deep. 

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east,
Beyond them far,
And to the earth
It gave great light,
And so it continued
Both day and night. 

And by the light
Of that same star,
Three wise men came
From country far;
To seek for a King
Was their intent,
And to follow the star,
Wherever it went. 

This star drew nigh
To the northwest,
O'er Bethlehem
It took its rest,
And there it did
Both stop and stay,
Right over the place
Where Jesus lay. 

Then entered in
Those wise men three,
Full rev'rently
Upon their knee,
And offered there
In His presence,
Their gold, and myrrh,
And frankincense. 

Then let us all
With one accord,
Sing praises to
Our heavenly Lord,
That hath made heav'n
And earth of naught,
And with His blood
Mankind hath bought.
