O For A Heart To Praise My God

O for a heart to praise my God,
A heart from sin set free,
A heart that always feels thy blood
So freely shed for me. 

A heart resigned, submissive, meek,
My great Redeemer's throne,
Where only Christ is heard to speak,
Where Jesus reigns alone. 

A humble, lowly, contrite heart,
Believing, true, and clean,
Which neither life nor death can part
From Christ who dwells within. 

A heart in every thought renewed
And full of love divine,
Perfect and right and pure and good,
A copy, Lord, of thine. 

Thy nature, gracious Lord, impart;
Come quickly from above;
Write thy new name upon my heart,
Thy new, best name of Love.
