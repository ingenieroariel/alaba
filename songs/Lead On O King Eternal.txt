Lead On O King Eternal

Lead on, O King Eternal.
The day of march has come;
Henceforth in fields of conquest
Thy tents shall be our home.
Thro' days of preparation
Thy grace has made us strong;
And now, O King eternal,
We lift our battle song. 

Lead on, O King Eternal,
Till sin's fierce war shall cease,
And holiness shall whisper
The sweet Amen of peace.
For not with swords loud clashing,
Nor roll of stirring drums;
With deeds of love and mercy,
The heav'nly kingdom comes. 

Lead on, O King Eternal,
We follow, not with fears;
For gladness breaks like morning
Where'er Thy face appears.
Thy cross is lifted o'er us;
We journey in its light.
The crown awaits the conquest;
Lead on, O God of might.
