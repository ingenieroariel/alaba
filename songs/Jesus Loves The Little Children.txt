Jesus Loves The Little Children

Jesus loves the little children,
All the children of the world.
Red and yellow, black and white,
They are precious in His sight--
Jesus loves the little children of the world. 

Jesus died for all the children,
All the children of the world.
Red and yellow, black and white,
All are precious in His sight--
Jesus died for all the children of the world.
