O Christmas Tree

O Christmas tree O Christmas tree,
You stand in verdant beauty.
O Christmas tree O Christmas tree,
You stand in verdant beauty.
Your boughs are green in summer's glow,
And do not fade in winter's snow.
O Christmas tree O Christmas tree,
You stand in verdant beauty. 

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Thy leaves are so unchanging,
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Thy leaves are so unchanging;
Not only green when summer's here,
But also when 'tis cold and drear.
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Thy leaves are so unchanging! 

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Thy candles shine so brightly,
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Thy candles shine so brightly! 

O Christmas Tree, O Christmas Tree,
You bear a wondrous message!
O Christmas Tree, O Christmas Tree,
You bear a wondrous message!
You do proclaim the Savior's birth,
Good will to men and peace on earth.
O Christmas Tree, O Christmas Tree,
You bear a wondrous message! 

O Christmas Tree, O Christmas tree,
Of all the trees most lovely;
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Of all the trees most lovely;
Each year you bring to me delight
Gleaming in the Christmas night.
O christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Of all the trees most lovely. 

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Your leaves will teach me also,
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Your leaves will teach me also
That hope and love and faithfulness
Are precious things I can possess.
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Your leaves will teach me also.
