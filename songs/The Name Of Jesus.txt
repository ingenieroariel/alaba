The Name Of Jesus

"Jesus," O how sweet the name!
"Jesus," every day the same!
"Jesus," let all saints proclaim
Its worthy praise forever! 

The name of Jesus is so sweet,
I love its music to repeat.
It makes my joys full and complete,
The precious name of Jesus! 

I love the name of Him whose heart,
Knows all my griefs and bears a part,
Who bids all anxious fears depart,
I love the name of Jesus. 

That name I fondly love to hear;
It never fails my heart to cheer;
It's music dries the falling tear.
Exalt the name of Jesus! 

No word of man can ever tell
How sweet the name I love so well.
O let its praises ever swell!
O praise the name of Jesus!
