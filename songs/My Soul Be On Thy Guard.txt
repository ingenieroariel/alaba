My Soul Be On Thy Guard

My soul be on thy guard;
Ten thousand foes arise;
The hosts of sin are pressing hard
To draw you from the skies. 

Oh, watch and fight and pray;
The battle ne'er give o'er.
Renew it boldly ev'ry day,
And help divine implore. 

Ne'er think the vict'ry won,
Nor lay thine armor down;
The work of faith will not be done
Till thou obtain the crown. 

Fight on, my soul, till death
Shall bring thee to thy God;
He'll take thee, at thy parting breath,
To His divine abode.
