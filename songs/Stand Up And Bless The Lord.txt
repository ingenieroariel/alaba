Stand Up And Bless The Lord

Stand up and bless the Lord your God
Ye people of God's choice;
Stand up and bless the Lord your God
With heart and soul and voice. 

Though high above all praise,
Above all blessing high,
Who would not fear His holy name,
And laud and magnify? 

O for the living flame
From God's own altar brought,
To touch our lips, our minds inspire,
And wing to heaven our thought! 

God is our strength and song,
Now is salvation ours;
Then be God's love in Christ proclaimed
With all our ransomed powers. 

Stand up and bless the Lord;
The Lord your God adore;
Stand up and bless God's glorious name,
Henceforth forevermore.
