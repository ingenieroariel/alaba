Tell It To Jesus

Tell it to Jesus,
Tell it to Jesus.
He is a Friend that's well known.
You have no other
Such a friend or brother.
Tell it to Jesus alone. 

Are you weary,
Are you heavy hearted?
Tell it to Jesus,
Tell it to Jesus.
Are you grieving
Over joys departed?
Tell it to Jesus alone. 

Do the tears flow down
Your cheeks unbidden?
Tell it to Jesus,
Tell it to Jesus.
Have you sins that
To men's eyes are hidden?
Tell it to Jesus alone. 

Do you fear the
Gathering clouds of sorrow?
Tell it to Jesus,
Tell it to Jesus.
Are you anxious
What shall be tomorrow?
Tell it to Jesus alone. 

Are you troubled
At the thought of dying?
Tell it to Jesus,
Tell it to Jesus.
For Christ's coming kingdom
Are you sighing?
Tell it to Jesus alone.
