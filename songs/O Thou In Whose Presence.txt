O Thou In Whose Presence

O Thou in whose presence
My soul takes delight,
On Whom in affliction I call
My Comfort by day
And my Song in the night,
My Hope, my Salvation, my All! 

Where dost Thou, dear Shepherd,
Resort with Thy sheep.
To feed them in pastures of love?
Say, why in the valley,
Of death should I weep,
Or alone in this wilderness rove? 

O, why should I wander,
An alien from Thee,
Or cry in the desert
For bread?
Thy foes will rejoice,
When my sorrows they see,
And smile at the tears,
I have shed. 

Ye daughters of Zion declare,
Have you seen the star,
That on Israel shone.
Say if in your tents,
My beloved has been,
And where with His flocks
He is gone. 

He looks! And ten thousands
Of angels rejoice,
And myriads wait for His word.
He speaks! And eternity,
Filled with His voice,
Re-echoes the praise of the Lord. 

Dear Shepherd! I hear,
And will follow Thy call;
I know the sweet sound of Thy voice.
Restore and defend me,
For Thou art my all,
And in Thee I will ever rejoice.
