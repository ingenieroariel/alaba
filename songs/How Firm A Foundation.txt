How Firm A Foundation

How firm a foundation
Ye saints of the Lord,
Is laid for your faith
In His excellent word,
What more can He say
Than to you He hath said,
To you who for refuge
To Jesus have fled. 

Fear not I am with Thee
O be not dismayed,
For I am Thy God
And will still give Thee aid,
I'll strengthen Thee help Thee
And cause Thee to stand,
Upheld by my righteous omnipotent hand. 

When through fiery trials
Thy pathway shall lie,
My grace all sufficient
Shall be Thy supply,
The flame shall not hurt Thee
I only design,
Thy dross to consume
And Thy gold to refine. 

When through the deep waters
I call Thee to go,
The rivers of sorrow
Shall not overflow,
For I will be with Thee
I only design,
And sanctify to Thee
Thy deepest distress. 

The soul that on Jesus
Hath leaned for repose,
I will not I will not
Desert to His foes,
That soul though all hell
Should endeavor to shake,
I'll never no never
No never forsake.
