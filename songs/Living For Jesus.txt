Living For Jesus

O Jesus, Lord and Savior,
I give myself to Thee.
For Thou in Thy atonement,
Didst give Thyself for me.
I own no other master,
My heart shall be Thy throne.
My life I give henceforth to live,
O Christ for Thee alone. 

Living for Jesus, a life that is true.
Striving to please Him in all that I do.
Yielding allegiance glad hearted and free.
This is the pathway of blessing for me. 

Living for Jesus who died in my place,
Bearing on Calvary, my sin and disgrace.
Such love constrains me, to answer His call,
Follow His leading and give Him my all. 

Living for Jesus, wherever I am.
Doing each duty in His holy name.
Willing to suffer affliction or loss.
Deeming each trial, a part of my cross. 

Living for Jesus, through earth's little while,
My dearest treasure, the light of His smile.
Seeking the lost ones, He died to redeem.
Bringing the weary to find rest in Him.
