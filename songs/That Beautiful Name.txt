That Beautiful Name

That beautiful name! That beautiful name
From sin has power to free us!
That beautiful name! That wonderful name!
That matchless name is Jesus. 

I know of a name, a beautiful name
That angels brought down to earth.
They whispered it low,
One night long ago
To a maiden of lowly birth. 

I know of a name, a beautiful name
That unto a babe was given.
The stars glittered bright
Throughout that glad nigh,
And angels praised God in heaven. 

The One of that name, my Savior became
My Savior of Calvary.
My sins nailed Him there,
My burdens He bare. 

I love that blest name
Made higher than all in heaven.
'Twas whispered, I know,
In my heart long ago.
To Jesus my life I've given.
