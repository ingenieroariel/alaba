There's A Wideness In God's Mercy

There's a wideness in God's mercy
Like the wideness of the sea;
There's a kindness in His justice,
Which is more than liberty. 

There is welcome for the sinner,
And more graces for the good.
There is mercy with the Savior;
There is healing in His blood. 

For the love of God is broader
Than the measure of man's mind;
And the heart of the Eternal
Is most wonderfully kind. 

If our love were but more simple,
We should take Him at His word;
And our lives would be all sunshine
In the sweetness of our Lord. 

There is plentiful redemption
In the blood that has been shed;
There is joy for all the members
In the sorrows of the Head.
