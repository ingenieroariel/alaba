Hosanna Loud Hosanna

Hosanna, loud hosanna,
The little children sang;
Through pillared court and temple,
The lovely anthem rang.
To Jesus, who had blessed them,
Close folded to His breast;
The children sang their praises,
The simplest and the best. 

From Olivet they followed,
'Mid an exultant crowd;
The victory palm branch waving,
And chanting clear and loud.
The Lord of men and angels,
Rode on in lowly state;
Nor scorned the little children,
Should on His bidding wait. 

"Hosanna in the highest!"
That ancient song we sing;
For Christ is our Redeemer,
The Lord of heaven, our King.
O may we ever praise Him
With heart and life and voice;
And in His holy presence
Eternally rejoice!
