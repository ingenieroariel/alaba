How Great Our Joy

How great our joy! Great our joy!
Joy, joy, joy!
Joy, joy, joy!
Praise we the Lord in heaven on high!
Praise we the Lord in heaven on high! 

While by the sheep we watched at night,
Glad tidings brought an angel bright. 

There shall be born so He did say,
In Bethlehem a Child today. 

There shall the Child lie in a stall,
This Child who shall redeem us all. 

This gift of God we'll cherish well,
That every joy our hearts shall fill.
