Pass Me Not

Savior, Savior, hear my humble cry.
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by. 

Pass me not, O gentle Savior;
Hear my humble cry.
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by. 

Let me at Thy throne of mercy
Find a sweet relief;
Kneeling there in deep contrition,
Help my unbelief. 

Trusting only in Thy merit,
Would I seek Thy face.
Heal my wounded, broken spirit.
Save me by Thy grace. 

Thou, the Spring of all my comfort,
More than life to me,
Whom have I on earth beside Thee?
Whom in heaven but Thee?
