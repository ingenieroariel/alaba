Jesus Is The Sweetest Name I Know

Jesus is the sweetest name I know,
And He's just the same as His lovely name,
And that's the reason why I love Him so;
Oh, Jesus is the sweetest name I know. 

There have been names that I have loved to hear,
But never has there been a name so dear
To this heart of mine as the name divine,
The precious, precious name of Jesus. 

There is no name in earth or heav'n above,
That we should give such honor and such love,
As the blessed name; let us all acclaim;
That wondrous, glorious name of Jesus. 

And some day I shall see Him face to face,
To thank and praise Him for His wondrous grace,
Which He gave to me when He made me free;
The blessed Son of God called Jesus.
