Rejoice The Lord Is King

Lift up your heart, lift up your voice;
Rejoice; again I say, rejoice.  

We soon shall hear the archangel's voice;
The trump of God shall sound, rejoice! 

Rejoice, the Lord is King!
Your Lord and King adore;
Mortals, give thanks and sing,
And triumph evermore. 

Jesus the Savior reigns,
The God of truth and love;
When He had purged our stains,
He took His seat above. 

His kingdom cannot fail;
He rules o'er earth and heaven;
The keys of earth and hell
Are to our Jesus given. 

Rejoice in glorious hope!
Jesus the Judge shall come
And take His servants up
To their eternal home.
