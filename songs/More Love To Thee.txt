More Love To Thee

More love O Christ to Thee;
More love to Thee,
More love to Thee! 

More love to Thee, O Christ,
More love to Thee!
Hear Thou the prayer,
I make on bended knee.
This is my earnest plea: 

Once earthly joy I craved,
Sought peace and rest.
Now Thee alone I seek;
Give what is best.
This all my prayer shall be: 

Then shall my latest breath
Whisper Thy praise.
This be the parting cry
My heart shall raise;
This still my prayer shall be: 

Let sorrow do its work,
Send grief and pain;
Sweet are Thy messengers,
Sweet their refrain,
When they can sing with me:
