Our Day Of Joy Is Here Again

Glory to our God, we sing,
Glory to our Lord and King;
Peace, goodwill with all abide,
This holy Christmas tide. 

Our day of joy is here again,
With love and peace and song;
Come, let us join the angelic strain
With voices clear and strong. 

When darkness lay upon the earth,
A glorious light did shine;
God sent a Gift of priceless worth
And showed His love divine. 

Now to the manger let us go
To worship and adore;
The tender Babe upon the straw,
Our Savior evermore. 

How wonderful that God's own Son
Should so Himself abase!
He thrust the mighty from their throne,
And gave the lowly grace.
