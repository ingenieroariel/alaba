Holy God We Praise Thy Name

Holy God, we praise Thy name;
Lord of all, we bow before Thee.
All on earth, Thy scepter claim,
All in heaven above adore Thee.
Infinite Thy vast domain,
Everlasting is Thy reign. 

Hark the glad celestial hymn;
Angel choirs above are raising.
Cherubim and seraphim,
In unceasing chorus praising;
Fill the heavens with sweet accord,
Holy, holy, holy Lord. 

All apostles join the strain,
As Thy sacred name they hallow.
Prophets swell the glad refrain
And the blessed martyrs follow
And from morn to set of sun,
Through the church the song goes on. 

Holy Father, holy Son,
Holy Spirit, three we name Thee.
Though in essence only one,
Undivided God we claim Thee;
And adoring bend the knee,
While we sing our praise to Thee.
