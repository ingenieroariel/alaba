God Will Take Care Of You

God will take care of you.
Thro' every day, o'er all the way,
He will take care of you;
God will take care of you. 

Be not dismayed whate'er betide,
God will take care of you;
Beneath His wings of love abide,
God will take care of you. 

Thro' days of toil,
When heart doth fail,
God will take care of you;
When dangers fierce your path assail,
God will take care of you. 

All you may need He will provide,
God will take care of you;
Nothing you ask will be denied,
God will take care of you. 

No matter what may be the test,
God will take care of you;
Lean, weary one, upon His breast,
God will take care of you.
