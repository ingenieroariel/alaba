You May Have The Joy Bells

Joy bells ringing in your heart!
Joy bells ringing in your heart!
Take the Savior here below
With you ev'rywhere you go;
He will keep the joy bells
Ringing in your heart. 

You may have the joy bells
Ringing in your heart,
And a peace that
From You never will depart.
Walk the straight and narrow way;
Live for Jesus ev'ry day.
He will keep the joy bells
Ringing in your heart. 

Love of Jesus in its fullness
You may know,
And this love to those around
You sweetly show.
Words of kindness always say;
Deeds of mercy do each day,
Then He'll keep the joy bells
Ringing in your heart. 

You will meet with trials
As you journey home;
Grace sufficent He will give to overcome.
Tho' unseen by mortal eye,
He is with you evernigh,
And He'll keep the joy bells
Ringing in your heart. 

Let your life speak well
Of Jesus ev'ry day;
Own His right to ev'ry service
You can pay.
Sinners you can help to win
If your life is pure and clean,
And you keep the joy bells
Ringing in your heart.
