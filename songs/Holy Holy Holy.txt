Holy Holy Holy

Holy, holy, holy,
Lord God Almighty!
Early in the morning
My song shall rise to Thee.
Holy, holy, holy!
Merciful and mighty!
God in three Persons,
Blessed Trinity! 

Holy, holy, holy!
All the saints adore Thee,
Casting down their golden crowns
Around the glassy sea;
Cherubim and seraphim
Falling down before Thee,
Which wert, and art,
And evermore shall be. 

Holy, holy, holy!
Though the darkness hide Thee,
Though the eye of sinful man
Thy glory may not see.
Only Thou art holy;
There is none beside Thee
Perfect in power,
In love, in purity. 

Holy, holy, holy!
Lord God Almighty!
All Thy works shall praise Thy name
In earth, and sky, and sea.
Holy, holy, holy!
Merciful and mighty!
God in three Persons,
Blessed Trinity.
