Ye Must Be Born Again

"Ye must be born again;
Ye must be born again.
I verily, verily say unto thee,
Ye must be born again." 

A ruler once came
To Jesus by night
To ask Him the way
Of salvation and light.
The Master made answer
In words true and plain,
"Ye must be born again." 

Ye children of men,
Attend to the word
So solemnly uttered
By Jesus, the Lord;
And let not this message
To you be in vain,
"Ye must be born again." 

O ye who would enter
That glorious rest,
And sing with the ransomed
The song of the blest,
The life everlasting
If ye would obtain,
"Ye must be born again." 

A dear one in heaven
Thy heart yearns to see,
At the beautiful gate
May be watching for thee;
Then list to the note
Of this solemn refrain,
"Ye must be born again."
