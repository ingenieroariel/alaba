O How I Love Jesus

O, how I love Jesus,
O, how I love Jesus,
O, how I love Jesus;
Because He first loved me.  

To me He is so wonderful,
To me He is so wonderful,
To me He is so wonderful;
Because He first loved me.  

O, how I love God's Word,
O, how I love God's Word,
O, how I love God's Word;
It tells of His love for me. 

There is a name I love to hear,
I love to sing its worth;
It sounds like music in my ear,
The sweetest name on earth. 

It tells me of a Savior's love,
Who died to set me free;
It tells me of His precious blood,
The sinner's perfect plea. 

It tells me what my Father hath,
In store for ev'ry day;
And tho' I tread a darksome path,
Yields sunshine all the way. 

It tells of One whose loving heart,
Can feel my deepest woe;
Who in each sorrow bears a part,
That none can bear below.
