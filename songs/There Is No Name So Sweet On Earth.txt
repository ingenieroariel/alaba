There Is No Name So Sweet On Earth

We love to sing of Christ our King
And hail Him blessed Jesus;
For there's no word ear ever heard,
So dear, so sweet as Jesus. 

There is no name so sweet on earth,
No name so sweet in heaven;
The name before His wondrous birth,
To Christ the Savior given. 

And when He hung upon the tree,
They wrote this name above Him;
That all might see the reason we,
For evermore must love Him. 

So now upon His Father's throne,
Almighty to release us;
From sin and pain He ever reigns,
The Prince and Savior Jesus. 

O Jesus, by that matchless name,
Thy grace shall fail us never;
Today as yesterday the same,
Thou art the same forever.
