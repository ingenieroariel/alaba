He Took My Sins Away

He took my sins away,
He took my sins away,
And keeps me singing every day!
I'm so glad He took my sins away.
He took my sins away. 

I came to Jesus, weary, worn and sad.
He took my sins away;
He took my sins away.
And now His love has made
My heart so glad.
He took my sins away. 

The load of sin was more
Than I could bear.
He took them all away;
He took them all away.
And now on Him I roll
My every care.
He took my sins away. 

No condemnation have I in my heart.
He took my sins away;
He took my sins away.
His perfect peace He did to me impart.
He took my sins away. 

If You will come to Jesus Christ today,
He'll take Your sins away,
He'll take Your sins away,
And keep You happy in His love each day.
He'll take Your sins away.
