Tis Marvelous And Wonderful

Wonderful, wonderful,
Marvelous and wonderful
What He has done for my soul!
The half has never been told
Oh, it is wonderful.
It is marvelous and wonderful
What Jesus has done for this soul of mine!
The half has never been told. 

The Savior has come in His mighty power,
And spoken peace to my soul.
And all of my life from that very hour,
I've yielded to His control.
I've yielded to His control. 

'Twas only a foretaste of joys divine
In Canaan waiting for me;
Where sweetest honey and milk and wine
Were dripping from ev'ry tree
Were dripping from ev'ry tree. 

From glory to glory He leads me on
From grace to grace ev'ry day;
And brighter and brighter the glory dawns
While pressing my homeward way
While pressing my homeward way. 

If fellowship here with my Lord can be
So inexpressibly sweet
Oh, what will it be when His face we see
When 'round the white throne we meet.
When 'round the white throne we meet.
