God Leads Us Along

Some thro' the waters,
Some thro' the flood,
Some thro' the fire,
But all thro' the blood;
Some thro' great sorrow,
But God gives a song,
In the night season,
And all the day long. 

In shady, green pastures,
So rich and so sweet,
God leads His dear children along;
Where the water's cool flow
Bathes the weary one's feet,
God leads His dear children along. 

Sometimes on the mount
Where the sun shines so bright,
God leads His dear children along;
Sometimes in the valley,
In darkest of night,
God leads His dear children along. 

Though sorrows befall us
And Satan oppose,
God leads His dear children along;
Through grace we can conquer,
Defeat all our foes,
God leads His dear children along. 

Away from the mire
And away from the clay,
God leads His dear children along;
Away up in glory, eternity's day
God leads His dear children along.
