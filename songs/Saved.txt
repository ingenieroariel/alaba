Saved

Saved! I'm saved thro' Christ,
My all in all.
Saved! I'm saved,
Whatever may befall.
He died upon the cross for me,
He bore the awful penalty.
And now I'm saved eternally,
I'm saved! Saved! Saved! 

Saved! Saved! Saved!
My sins are all forgiv'n,
Christ is mine!
I'm on my way to heaven,
Once a guilty sinner, lost, undone,
Now a child of God,
Saved thro' His Son. 

Saved! Saved! Saved!
By grace and grace alone.
Oh, what wondrous love
To me was shown,
In my stead
Christ Jesus bled and died.
Bore my sins,
For me was crucified. 

Saved! Saved! Saved!
Oh joy beyond compare!
Christ my life,
And I His constant care,
Yielding all and trusting Him alone,
Living now each moment as His own.
