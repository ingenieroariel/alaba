He Keeps Me Singing

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
Sweetest name I know,
Fills my ev'ry longing,
Keeps me singing as I go. 

There's within my heart a melody.
Jesus whispers sweet and low:
"Fear not, I am with thee; peace, be still,"
In all of life's ebb and flow. 

All my life was wrecked by sin and strife;
Discord filled my life with pain.
Jesus swept across the broken strings,
Stirred the slumb'ring chords again. 

Feasting on the riches of His grace,
Resting 'neath His shelt'ring wing,
Always looking on His smiling face,
That is why I shout and sing. 

Tho' sometimes He leads thro' waters deep,
Trials fall across my way,
Tho' sometimes the path seems rough and steep,
See His footprints all the way. 

Soon He's coming back to welcome me
Far beyond the starry sky.
I shall wing my flight to worlds unknown;
I shall reign with Him on high.
