Singing I Go

Singing I go along life's road,
Praising the Lord, praising the Lord;
Singing I go along life's road,
For Jesus has lifted my load. 

The trusting heart to Jesus clings,
Nor any ill forebodes,
But at the cross of Calvary sings,
"Praise God for lifted loads!" 

The passing days bring many cares.
"Fear not," I hear Him say;
And when my fears are turned to prayers,
The burdens slip away. 

He tells me of my Father's love,
And never slumbering eye;
My everlasting King above
Will all my needs supply. 

When to the throne of grace I flee,
I find the promise true;
The mighty arms upholding me
Will bear my burdens too.
