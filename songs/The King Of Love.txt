The King Of Love

The King of love my Shepherd is,
Whose goodness faileth never;
I nothing lack if I am His,
And He is mine forever. 

Where streams of living water flow
My ransomed soul He leadeth;
And where the verdant pastures grow,
With food celestial feedeth. 

Perverse and foolish oft I strayed
But yet in love He sought me.
And on His shoulder gently laid,
And home rejoicing brought me. 

In death's dark vale I fear no ill
With Thee, dear Lord beside me;
Thy rod and staff my comfort still,
Thy cross before to guide me. 

And so through all the length of days,
Thy goodness faileth never.
Good Shepherd, may I sing Thy praise,
Within Thy house forever.
