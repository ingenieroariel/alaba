I Love To Walk With Jesus

I will follow where He leadeth;
I will pasture where He feedeth.
I will follow all the way, Lord.
I will follow Jesus ev'ry day. 

Oh, I love to walk with Jesus,
Like the publicans of old.
When He gathered them about Him
And the blessed tidings told:
How He came to bring deliv'rance
To the captives in distress.
Take away our ev'ry burden,
Giving perfect peace and rest. 

O I love to walk with Jesus
Like the man of long ago
Who had tarried by the wayside
Near the gates of Jericho.
Jesus heard his cry for mercy,
Gave him back his sight that day,
And immediately he followed Jesus
All along the way. 

O I love to walk with Jesus
All the way to Calv'ry's brow,
Gaze upon that scene of suff'ring
While my tears of sorrow flow.
There He tells me how He loves me,
Takes my ev'ry sin away;
So I follow Him so gladly,
Lead me anywhere He may. 

O sometime I'll walk with Jesus
In the land of endless day,
When our journey here is over
And we've reached our home to stay.
Then I'll walk with Him forever,
Sing His praises o'er and o'er,
And with all the saints in glory
Love and worship and adore.
