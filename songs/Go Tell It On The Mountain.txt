Go Tell It On The Mountain

Go tell it on the mountain,
Over the hills and everywhere;
Go tell it on the mountain,
That Jesus Christ is born. 

Down in a lowly manger,
The humble Christ was born;
And brought us God's salvation,
That blessed Christmas morn. 

When I was a seeker,
I sought both night and day;
I asked the Lord to help me,
And He showed me the way. 

He made me a watchman,
Upon the city wall;
And if I am a Christian,
I am the least of all. 

While shepherds kept their watching,
O'er silent flocks by night;
Behold throughout the heavens,
There shone a holy light. 

And lo, when they had seen it,
They all bowed down and prayed;
They traveled on together
To where the Babe was laid. 

The shepherds feared and trembled,
When lo above the earth;
Rang out the angel chorus,
That hailed our Savior's birth. 

When I was a sinner,
I prayed both night and day;
I asked the Lord to help me,
And He showed me the way.
