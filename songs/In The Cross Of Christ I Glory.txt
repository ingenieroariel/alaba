In The Cross Of Christ I Glory

In the cross of Christ I glory,
Tow'ring o'er the wrecks of time;
All the light of sacred story
Gathers round its head sublime. 

When the woes of life o'ertake me,
Hopes deceive and fears annoy;
Never shall the cross forsake me,
Lo! it glows with peace and joy. 

When the sun of bliss is beaming
Light and love upon my way;
From the cross the radiance streaming
Adds more luster to the day. 

Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure,
By the cross are sanctified;
Peace is there that knows no measure,
Joys that thro' all time abide.
