There Is A Fountain

There is a fountain filled with blood
Drawn from Immanuel's veins;
And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,
Lose all their guilty stains:
Lose all their guilty stains,
Lose all their guilty stains;
And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,
Lose all their guilty stains. 

The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in his day;
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away:
Wash all my sins away,
Wash all my sins away;
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away. 

Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood
Shall never lose its power
Till all the ransomed church of God
Are saved, to sin no more:
Are saved, to sin no more,
Are saved, to sin no more;
Till all the ransomed church of God
Are saved, to sin no more. 

For since by faith I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die:
And shall be till I die,
And shall be till I die;
Redeeming love has been my theme
And shall be till I die. 

When this poor lisping, stamm'ring tongue
Lies silent in the grave,
Then in a nobler, sweeter song
I'll sing Thy pow'r to save:
Then in a nobler sweeter song
I'll sing Thy pow'r to save;
I'll sing Thy pow'r to save,
I'll sing Thy pow'r to save;
Then in a nobler sweeter song
I'll sing Thy pow'r to save. 

E'er since by faith I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die:
And shall be till I die,
And shall be till I die;
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die.
