Savior Like A Shepherd Lead Us

Savior, like a shepherd lead us;
Much we need Your tender care.
In Your pleasant pastures feed us,
For our use Your folds prepare.
Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus,
You have bought us: Yours we are. 

We are Yours; in love befriend us,
Be the guardian of our way;
Keep Your flock, from sin defend us,
Seek us when we go astray.
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
Hear Your children when we pray. 

You have promised to receive us,
Poor and sinful though we be;
You have mercy to relieve us,
Grace to cleanse, and power to free.
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
Early let us turn to You. 

Early let us seek Your favor,
Early let us do Your will;
Blessed Lord and only Savior,
With Your love our spirits fill.
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
You have loved us; love us still.
