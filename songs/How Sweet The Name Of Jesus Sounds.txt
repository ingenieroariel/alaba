How Sweet The Name Of Jesus Sounds

How sweet the name of Jesus sounds,
In a believer's ear;
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds
And drives away his fear. 

It makes the wounded Spirit whole
And calms the troubled breast;
'Tis manna to the hungry soul
And to the weary, rest. 

Dear name! the Rock on which I build,
My shield and hiding place;
My never failing treasure,
Filled with boundless stores of grace. 

Jesus, my Shepherd, Brother, Friend,
My Prophet, Priest, and King
My Lord, my Life, my Way, my End,
Accept the praise I bring. 

Weak is the effort of my heart
And cold my warmest thought;
But when I see Thee as Thou art,
I'll praise Thee as I ought. 

Till then I would Thy love proclaim
With ev'ry fleeting breath;
And may the music of Thy name
Refresh my soul in death.
