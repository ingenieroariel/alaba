Jesus The Very Thought Of Thee

Jesus, the very thought of Thee,
With sweetness fills my breast;
But sweeter far Thy face to see,
And in Thy presence rest. 

No voice can sing, no heart can frame,
Nor can the memory find
A sweeter sound than Thy blest name;
O Savior of mankind! 

O Hope of every contrite heart,
O Joy of all the meek;
To those who fall, how kind Thou art!
How good to those who seek! 

But what to those who find?
Ah, this no tongue or pen can show;
The love of Jesus, what it is
None but His loved ones know. 

Jesu, our only joy be Thou,
As Thou our prize wilt be;
Jesus, be Thou our Glory now,
And thru eternity.
Amen.
