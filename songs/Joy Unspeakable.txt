Joy Unspeakable

It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
Full of glory, full of glory.
It is joy unspeakable and full of glory.
Oh the half has never yet been told! 

I have found His grace in all complete;
He supplieth every need.
While I sit and learn at Jesus feet,
I am free, yes, free indeed. 

I have found the pleasure I once craved;
It is joy and peace within.
What a wondrous blessing! I am saved
From the awful gulf of sin. 

I have found that hope
so bright and clear,
Living in the realm of grace.
Oh the Savior's presence is so near,
I can see His smiling face. 

I have found the joy no tongue can tell.
How its waves of glory roll!
It is like a great o'er flowing well
Springing up within my soul.
