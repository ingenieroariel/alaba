It Is Well With My Soul

It is well, with my soul,
It is well,
It is well, with my soul. 

When peace like a river,
Attendeth my way,
When sorrows,
Like sea billows roll;
Whatever my lot,
Thou hast taught me to say,
"It is well,
It is well, with my soul." 

Though Satan should buffet,
Tho' trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control;
That Christ has regarded
My helpless estate,
And hath shed His own blood
For my soul. 

My sin, O the bliss
Of this glorious tho't,
My sin not in part
But the whole
Is nailed to the cross
And I bear it no more.
Praise the Lord,
Praise the Lord, O my soul! 

O, Lord haste the day
When my faith shall be sight,
The clouds be rolled back
As a scroll;
The trump shall resound
And the Lord shall descend,
"Even so" it is well
With my soul.
