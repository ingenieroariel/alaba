I Sing The Mighty Power Of God

I sing the mighty power of God,
That made the mountains rise;
That spread the flowing seas abroad,
And built the lofty skies,
That spread the flowing seas abroad,
And built the lofty skies. 

I sing the goodness of the Lord,
That filled the earth with food;
He formed the creatures with His word,
And then pronounced them good,
He formed the creatures with His word,
And then pronounced them good. 

There's not a plant or flower below,
But makes Thy glories known;
And clouds arise, and tempests blow,
By order from Thy throne;
And clouds arise, and tempests blow,
By order from Thy throne.
Amen.
