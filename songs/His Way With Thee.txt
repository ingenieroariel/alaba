His Way With Thee

His power can make you
What you ought to be.
His blood can cleanse your heart
And make you free.
His love can fill your soul
And you will see
'Twas best for Him to have
His way with thee. 

Would you live for Jesus,
And be always pure and good?
Would you walk with Him
Within the narrow road?
Would you have Him bear your burden,
Carry all your load?
Let Him have His way with thee. 

Would you have Him make you free,
And follow at His call?
Would you know the peace
That comes by giving all?
Would you have Him save you,
So that you need never fall?
Let Him have His way with thee. 

Would you in His kingdom
Find a place of constant rest?
Would you prove Him true
In providential test?
Would you in His service labor
Always at your best?
Let Him have His way with thee.
