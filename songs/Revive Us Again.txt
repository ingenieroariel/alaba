Revive Us Again

Hallelujah! Thine the glory!
Hallelujah! Amen!
Hallelujah! Thine the glory!
Revive us again. 

We praise Thee, O God,
For the Son of Thy love;
For Jesus, who died
And is now gone above. 

We praise Thee, O God,
For Thy Spirit of light,
Who has shown us our Savior
And scattered our night. 

All glory and praise
To the Lamb that was slain,
Who has borne all our sins
And hath cleansed every stain. 

Revive us again;
Fill each heart with Thy love;
May each soul be rekindled
With fire from above.
