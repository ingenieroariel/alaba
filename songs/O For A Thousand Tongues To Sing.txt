O For A Thousand Tongues To Sing

O for a thousand tongues to sing
My great Redeemer's praise,
The glories of my God and King,
The triumphs of His grace! 

My gracious Master and my God,
Assist me to proclaim,
To spread through all the earth abroad,
The honors of Thy name. 

Jesus! The name that charms our fears,
That bids our sorrows cease;
'Tis music in the sinner's ears;
'Tis life, and health, and peace. 

He breaks the power of canceled sin;
He sets the prisoner free.
His blood can make the foulest clean;
His blood availed for me. 

Hear Him, ye deaf, His praise, ye dumb,
Your loosened tongues employ.
Ye blind, behold your Savior come,
And leap ye lame for joy. 

Glory to God and praise and love
Be ever, ever giv'n
By saints below and saints above
The church in earth and heav'n.
