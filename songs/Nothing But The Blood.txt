Nothing But The Blood

Oh! precious is the flow,
That makes me white as snow;
No other fount I know;
Nothing but the blood of Jesus. 

What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus. 

For my pardon, this I see;
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
For my cleansing, this my plea;
Nothing but the blood of Jesus. 

Nothing can for sin atone,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
Naught of good that I have done,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus. 

This is all my hope and peace,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
This is all my righteousness,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
