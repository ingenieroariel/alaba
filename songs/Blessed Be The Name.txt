Blessed Be The Name

Blessed be the name,
Blessed be the name,
Blessed be the name of the Lord;
Blessed be the name,
Blessed be the name,
Blessed be the name of the Lord. 

All praise to Him who reigns above,
In majesty supreme
Who gave His Son for man to die,
That He might man redeem! 

His name above all names shall stand,
Exalted more and more,
At God the Father's own right hand,
Where angel hosts adore. 

Redeemer, Savior, Friend of man,
Once ruined by the fall,
Thou hast devised salvation's plan,
For Thou hast died for all. 

His name shall be the Counselor,
The mighty Prince of Peace,
Of all earth's kingdoms Conqueror,
Whose reign shall never cease.
