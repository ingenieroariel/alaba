I Surrender All

I surrender all,
I surrender all.
All to Thee my blessed Savior,
I surrender all. 

All to Jesus I surrender,
All to Him I freely give;
I will ever love and trust Him,
In His presence daily live. 

All to Jesus I surrender,
Humbly at His feet I bow,
Worldly pleasures all forsaken,
Take me Jesus take me now. 

All to Jesus I surrender,
Make me Savior wholly Thine;
Let me feel the Holy Spirit,
Truly know that Thou art mine. 

All to Jesus I surrender,
Lord I give myself to Thee.
Fill me with Thy love and power;
Let Thy blessings fall on me. 

All to Jesus I surrender,
Now I feel the sacred flame.
Oh the joy of full salvation!
Glory, glory to His name!
