We Three Kings Of Orient Are

O star of wonder, star of night,
Star with royal beauty bright;
Westward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us to Thy perfect light. 

We three kings of Orient are,
Bearing gifts we traverse afar;
Field and fountain moor and mountain,
Following yonder star. 

Born a King on Bethlehem's plain,
Gold I bring to crown Him again;
King forever, ceasing never,
Over us all to reign. 

Frankincense to offer have I,
Incense owns a Deity nigh;
Prayer and praising, all men raising,
Worship Him, God on high. 

Myrrh is mine, its bitter perfume,
Breathes a life of gathering gloom;
Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying,
Sealed in the stone cold tomb. 

Glorious now behold Him arise,
King and God and sacrifice;
Alleluia, alleluia!
Earth to heav'n replies.
