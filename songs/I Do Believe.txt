I Do Believe

I do believe, I now believe
That Jesus died for me; 

Father, I stretch my hands to Thee;
No other help I know.
If Thou withdraw thyself from me,
Ah, whither shall I go? 

What did Thine only Son endure
Before I drew my breath!
What pain, what labor,
To secure my soul from endless death! 

Author of faith, to Thee I lift
My weary, longing eyes.
Oh, let me now receive that gift;
My soul, without it, dies. 

Surely Thou canst not let me die;
Oh, speak, and I shall live.
And here I will unwearied lie
Till Thou Thy Spirit give. 

How would my fainting soul rejoice
Could I but see Thy face!
now let me hear Thy quick'ning voice,
And taste Thy pard'ning grace.
