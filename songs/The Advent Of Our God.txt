The Advent Of Our God

The advent of our God,
With eager hearts we greet;
And we must praise Him in this hour,
With hymns and anthems sweet. 

All glory to the Son,
Who comes to set us free;
With Father, Spirit ever One,
Through all eternity. 

The everlasting Son,
Incarnate stoops to be;
Himself the servant's form
Puts on to set his people free. 

Come, Zion's daughter,
Rise to meet your lowly King;
Nor let your faithless heart despise
The peace He comes to bring. 

As judge, on clouds of light,
He soon will come again;
And all His scattered saints
Unite with Him on high to reign. 

Before the dawning day
Let sin be put to flight;
No longer let the law hold sway,
But walk in freedom's light.
