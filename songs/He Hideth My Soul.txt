He Hideth My Soul

He hideth my soul
In the cleft of the rock
That shadows a dry, thirsty land.
He hideth my life
In the depths of His love.
And covers me there with His hand.
And covers me there with His hand. 

A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,
A wonderful Savior to me.
He hideth my soul
In the cleft of the rock,
Where rivers of pleasure I see. 

A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord.
He taketh my burden away.
He holdeth me up
And I shall not be moved.
He giveth me strength as my day. 

With numberless blessings
Each moment He crowns;
And filled with His fullness divine,
I sing in my rapture, "Oh, glory to God
For such a Redeemer as mine!" 

When clothed in His brightness
Transported I rise,
To meet Him in clouds of the sky,
His perfect salvation,
His wonderful love I'll shout
With the millions on high.
