Jesus Paid It All

Jesus paid it all, all to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain,
He washed it white as snow. 

I hear the Savior say,
"Thy strength indeed is small;
Child of weakness watch and pray,
Find in Me thine all in all." 

Lord, now indeed I find,
Thy power and Thine alone;
Can change the leper's spots
And melt the heart of stone. 

For nothing good have I,
Whereby Thy grace to claim;
I'll wash my garments white,
In the blood of Calvary's Lamb. 

And when before the throne,
I stand in Him complete;
"Jesus died my soul to save,"
My lips shall still repeat.
