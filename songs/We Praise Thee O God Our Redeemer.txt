We Praise Thee O God Our Redeemer

We praise Thee, O God,
Our Redeemer, Creator
In grateful devotion
Our tribute we bring;
We lay it before Thee,
We kneel and adore Thee,
We bless Thy holy name,
Glad praises we sing. 

We worship Thee,
God of our fathers,
We bless Thee
Thru life's storm and tempest,
Our guide has Thou been;
When perils o'er take us,
Escape Thou wilt make us,
And with Thy help, O Lord,
Our battles we win. 

With voices united
Our praises we offer
To Thee, great Jehovah,
Glad anthems we raise;
Thy strong arm will guide us,
Our God is beside us,
To Thee, our great Redeemer,
Forever be praise!
