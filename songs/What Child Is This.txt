What Child Is This

This, this is Christ the King,
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing.
Haste, haste to bring Him laud,
The Babe, the Son of Mary. 

What child is this who,
Laid to rest,
On Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,
While shepherds watch are keeping. 

Why lies He in such mean estate
Where ox and ass are feeding?
Good Christian, fear;
For sinners here
The silent Word is pleading. 

So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh;
Come peasant, king to own Him.
The King of kings salvation brings;
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.
