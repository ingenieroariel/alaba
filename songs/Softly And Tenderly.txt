Softly And Tenderly

Come home, come home.
Ye who are weary, come home.
Earnestly, tenderly Jesus is calling,
Calling, "O sinner, come home!" 

Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling,
Calling for you and for me.
See, on the portals,
He's waiting and watching,
Watching for you and for me. 

Why should we tarry
When Jesus is pleading,
Pleading for you and for me?
Why should we linger
And heed not His mercies,
Mercies for you and for me? 

Time is now fleeting;
The moments are passing,
Passing from you and from me.
Shadows are gathering;
Death's night is coming,
Coming for you and for me. 

Oh for the wonderful
Love He has promised,
Promised for you and for me!
Though we have sinned,
He has mercy and pardon,
Pardon for you and for me.
