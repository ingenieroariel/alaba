Praise My Soul The King Of Heaven

Praise my soul, the King of heaven,
To His feet thy tribute bring;
Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,
Evermore His praises sing;
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Praise the everlasting King. 

Praise Him, for His grace and favor,
To our fathers in distress;
Praise Him, still the same as ever,
Slow to chide and swift to bless,
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Glorious in His faithfulness. 

Frail as summer's flow'r we flourish,
Blows the wind and it is gone;
But while mortals rise and perish,
God endures unchanging on.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Praise the high Eternal One. 

Angels in the height, adore Him,
Ye behold Him face to face;
Saints triumphant, bow before Him,
Gathered in from every race.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Praise with us, the God of grace.
