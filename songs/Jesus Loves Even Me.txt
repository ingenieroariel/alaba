Jesus Loves Even Me

I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves me.
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves even me. 

I am so glad that our Father in heaven
Tells of His love in the book He has giv'n.
Wonderful things in the Bible I see.
This is the dearest that Jesus loves me. 

Tho' I forget Him and wander away,
Still He doth love me wherever I stray.
Back to His dear loving arms would I flee
When I remember that Jesus loves me. 

Oh, if there's only one song I can sing,
When in His beauty I see the great King,
This shall my song in eternity be.
Oh what a wonder that Jesus love me.
