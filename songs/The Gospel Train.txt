The Gospel Train

Oh I'm trav'ling on the hallelujah line,
On the good old gospel train.
I am on the right track,
And never will go back
To the station of sin again.
I am trav'ling on the hallelujah line,
On the good old gospel train.
I need no fare, I'm riding on a pass,
'Tis the blood for sinners slain.
