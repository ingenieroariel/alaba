The God Of Abraham Praise

The God of Abraham praise,
Who reigns enthroned above;
Ancient of everlasting days,
And God of love.
Jehovah, great I Am,
By earth and heaven confessed;
I bow and bless the sacred name,
Forevermore blest. 

The God of Abraham praise,
At whose supreme command;
From earth I rise,
And seek the joys
At His right hand.
I all on earth forsake,
Its wisdom, fame, and power;
And Him my only portion make,
My shield and tower. 

He by Himself hath sworn,
I on His oath depend;
I shall on eagles wings upborne,
To heaven ascend.
I shall behold His face,
I shall His power adore;
And sing the wonders
Of His grace forevermore. 

The whole triumphant host,
Give thanks to God on high;
"Hail, Father, Son and Holy Ghost!"
They ever cry.
Hail, Abraham's God and mine!
I join the heavenly lays,
All might and majesty are Thine;
And endless praise.
Amen.
