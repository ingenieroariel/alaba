Open My Eyes That I May See

Open my eyes that I may see
Glimpses of truth Thou hast for me;
Place in my hands the wonderful key
That shall unclasp and set me free.
Silently now I wait for Thee,
Ready my God Thy will to see.
Open my eyes. Illumine me, Spirit divine! 

Open my ears that I may hear
Voices of truth Thou sendest clear;
And while the wave-notes fall on my ear,
Everything false will disappear.
Silently now I wait for Thee,
Ready my God Thy will to see.
Open my ears, Illumine me, Spirit divine! 

Open my mouth and let me bear
Gladly the warm truth everywhere.
Open my heart and let me prepare
Love with Thy children thus to share.
Silently now I wait for Thee,
Ready my God Thy will to see.
Open my heart. Illumine me, Spirit divine! 

Open my mind that I may read
More of Thy love in word and deed.
What shall I fear while yet Thou dost lead?
Only for light from Thee I plead.
Silently now I wait for Thee,
Ready, my God, Thy will to see.
Open my mind. Illumine me, Spirit divine!
