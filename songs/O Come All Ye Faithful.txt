O Come All Ye Faithful

O come all ye faithful,
Joyful and triumphant,
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem;
Come and behold Him,
Born the King of angels:  

O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord. 

God of God,
Light of light,
Lo! He abhors not the virgin's womb;
Very God,
Begotton not created: 

Sing, choirs of angels,
Sing in exultation,
Sing all ye citizens of heaven above:
Glory to God
In the highest: 

Yea, Lord, we greet Thee,
Born this happy morning,
Jesu, to Thee be glory given;
Word of the Father,
Now in flesh appearing:
