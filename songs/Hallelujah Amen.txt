Hallelujah Amen

Hallelujah! Amen!
Hallelujah! Amen!
Hallelujah! Amen!
Amen! Amen! 

How oft in holy converse with Christ,
My Lord alone,
I seem to hear the millions
That sing around His throne: 

They passed thro' toils and trials
And, tho' the strife was long,
They share the victor's conquest,
And sing the victor's song: 

My soul takes up the chorus
And, pressing on my way,
Communing still with Jesus,
I sing from day to day: 

Thro' grace I soon shall conquer,
And reach my home on high;
And thro' eternal ages
I'll shout beyond the sky:
