Sweet Hour Of Prayer

Sweet hour of prayer,
Sweet hour of prayer,
That calls me from a world of care
And bids me at my Father's throne
Make all my wants and wishes known.
In seasons of distress and grief
My soul has often found relief,
And oft escaped the tempter's snare,
By Thy return sweet hour of prayer. 

Sweet hour of prayer,
Sweet hour of prayer.
The joys I feel, the bliss I share.
Of those whose anxious spirits burn
With strong desires for Thy return.
With such I hasten to the place
Where God, my Savior, shows His face.
And gladly take my station there,
And wait for Thee, sweet hour of prayer. 

Sweet hour of prayer,
Sweet hour of prayer,
Thy wings shall my petition bear
To Him whose truth and faithfulness
Engage the waiting soul to bless;
And since He bids me seek His face,
Believe His word, and trust His grace,
I'll cast on Him my ev'ry care.
And wait for Thee, sweet hour of prayer. 

Sweet hour of prayer,
Sweet hour of prayer,
May I Thy consolation share,
'Til from Mount Pisgah's lofty height,
I view my home and take my flight.
This robe of flesh
I'll drop and rise
To seize the everlasting prize,
And shout while passing through the air,
Farewell, farewell sweet hour of prayer.
