Of The Father's Love Begotten

Of the Father's love begotten,
Ere the world began to be;
He is Alpha and Omega,
He the source, the ending He.
Of the things that are that have been
And that future years shall see;
Evermore and evermore! 

O, ye heights of heaven adore Him,
Angel hosts; His praises sing;
Pow'rs, dominions, bow before Him
And extol our God and King;
Let no tongue on earth be silent,
Ev'ry voice in concert ring;
Evermore and evermore! 

Christ, to Thee with God the Father,
And, O Holy Ghost, to Thee;
Hymn and chant and high thanksgiving
And unwearied praises be:
Honor, glory, and dominion and eternal victory;
Evermore and evermore!
Amen. 

O that birth forever blessed
When the Virgin, full of grace,
By the Holy Ghost conceiving,
Bare the Savior of our race;
And the Babe, the world's Redeemer
First revealed His sacred face,
Evermore and evermore!
