O For A Faith That Will Not Shrink

O for a faith that will not shrink,
Tho' pressed by ev'ry foe,
That will not tremble on the brink
Of any earthly woe! 

That will not murmur nor complain,
Beneath the chastening rod
But in the hour of grief or pain,
Will lean upon its God. 

A faith that shines more bright and clear
When tempests rage without;
That when in danger knows no fear,
In darkness feels no doubt. 

That bears, unmoved, the world's dread frown,
Nor heeds its scornful smile;
That seas of trouble cannot drown,
Nor Satan's arts beguile. 

Lord give us such a faith as this;
And then whate'er may come,
We'll taste e'en here the hollowed bliss,
Of an eternal home.
