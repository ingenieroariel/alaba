I Would Be Like Jesus

Be like Jesus, this my song,
In the home and in the throng;
Be like Jesus, all day long!
I would be like Jesus. 

Earthly pleasures vainly call me;
I would be like Jesus;
Nothing worldly shall enthrall me;
I would be like Jesus. 

He has broken ev'ry fetter,
I would be like Jesus;
That my soul may serve Him better,
I would be like Jesus. 

All the way from earth to glory,
I would be like Jesus;
Telling o'er and o'er the story,
I would be like Jesus. 

That in heaven He may meet me,
I would be like Jesus;
That His words "Well done," may greet me,
I would be like Jesus.
