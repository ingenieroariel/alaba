In The Sweet By And By

In the sweet by and by,
In the sweet by and by,
I'll have a mansion so bright and fair,
Won't it be glorious when I get there,
In the sweet by and by,
In the sweet by and by,
When the battle is done,
And the vict'ry is won,
In the sweet by and by. 

In the sweet by and by,
In the sweet by and by,
I'll stand at last on the street of pure gold,
Wonders and glory of heav'n behold,
In the sweet by and by,
In the sweet by and by,
Joy will be so complete when my Savior I meet,
In the sweet by and by.
