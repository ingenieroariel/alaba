Majestic Sweetness Sits Enthroned

Majestic sweetness sits enthroned,
Upon the Savior's brow;
His head with radiant glories crowned,
His lips with grace o'erflow,
His lips with grace o'erflow. 

No mortal can with Him compare
Among the sons of men;
Fairer is He than all the fair
Who fill the heav'nly train,
Who fill the heav'nly train. 

He saw me plunged in deep distress,
He flew to my relief;
For me He bore the shameful Cross,
And carried all my grief,
And carried all my grief. 

To Him I owe my life and breath
And all the joys I have;
He makes me triumph over death,
And saves me from the grave,
And saves me from the grave. 

Since from His bounty I receive
Such proofs of love divine,
Had I a thousand hearts to give,
Lord they should all be Thine;
Lord they should all be Thine.
