I Will Praise Him

I will praise Him, I will praise Him,
Praise the Lamb for sinners slain.
Give Him glory all ye people,
For His blood can wash away each stain. 

When I saw the cleansing fountain
Open wide for all my sin,
I obeyed the Spirit's wooing
When He said "Wilt thou be clean?" 

Tho' the way seemed straight and narrow,
All I claimed was swept away;
My ambitions, plans and wishes
At my feet in ashes lay. 

Then God's fire upon the altar
Of my heart was set aflame.
I shall never cease to praise Him.
Glory, glory to His name! 

Blessed be the name of Jesus!
I'm so glad He took me in.
He's forgiven my transgressions;
He has cleansed my heart from sin. 

Glory, glory to the Father!
Glory, glory to the Son!
Glory, glory to the Spirit!
Glory to the Three in One!
