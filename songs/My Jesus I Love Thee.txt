My Jesus I Love Thee

My Jesus I love Thee;
I know Thou art mine.
For Thee all the follies
Of sin I resign.
My gracious Redeemer,
My Savior art Thou.
If ever I loved Thee,
My Jesus, 'tis now. 

I love Thee,
Because Thou hast first loved me,
And purchased my pardon
On Calvary's tree.
I love Thee
For wearing the thorns
On Thy brow,
If ever I loved Thee,
My Jesus, 'tis now. 

I'll love Thee in life,
I will love Thee in death,
And praise Thee
As long as Thou lendest me breath;
And say when the death dew
Lies cold on my brow,
"If ever I loved Thee,
My Jesus 'tis now." 

In mansions of glory
And endless delight,
I'll ever adore Thee
In heaven so bright.
I'll sing with the glittering crown
On my brow,
"If ever I loved Thee,
My Jesus, 'tis now."
