Take The Name Of Jesus With You

Precious name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of heaven.
Precious name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of heaven. 

Take the name of Jesus with you.
Child of sorrow and of woe.
It will joy and comfort give you;
Take it then where'er you go. 

Take the name of Jesus ever,
As a shield from every snare.
If temptations round you gather,
Breathe that holy name in prayer. 

O the precious name of Jesus!
How it thrills our souls with joy.
When His loving arms receive us
And His songs our tongues employ! 

At the name of Jesus bowing,
Falling prostrate at His feet.
King of kings in heaven we'll crown Him,
When our journey is complete.
