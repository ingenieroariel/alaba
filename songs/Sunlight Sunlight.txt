Sunlight Sunlight

Sunlight, sunlight in my soul today!
Sunlight, sunlight all along the way!
Since the Savior found me,
Took away my sin,
I have had the sunlight of His love within. 

I wandered in the shades of night
Till Jesus came to me,
And with the sunlight of His love
Bid all my darkness flee. 

Tho clouds may gather in the sky,
And billows round me roll,
However dark the world may be,
I've sunlight in my soul, 

While walking in the light of God,
I sweet communion find;
I press with holy vigor on,
And leave the world behind. 

I cross the wide extended fields,
I journey o'er the plain,
And in the sunlight of His love
I reap the golden grain. 

Soon I shall see Him as He is,
The light that came to me;
Behold the brightness of His face
Thro'out eternity.
