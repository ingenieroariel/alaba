Tell Me The Story Of Jesus

... all the rich treasures of wisdom, unto my soul impart.
Tell me the beautiful story, the wonderful, wonderful
Story; tell me the beautiful story of Jesus and His love.
Tell me the story of Jesus, tell of His wondrous love; tell
Of His mercy to sinners, tell of the home above.
