I Will Sing Of My Redeemer

Sing, oh sing, of my Redeemer.
With His blood He purchased me.
On the cross He sealed my pardon,
Paid the debt and made me free. 

I will sing of my Redeemer,
And His wondrous love to me.
On the cruel cross He suffered,
From the curse to set me free. 

I will tell the wondrous story,
How my lost estate to save,
In His boundless love and mercy
He the ransom freely gave. 

I will praise my dear Redeemer;
His triumphant power I'll tell,
How the victory He giveth
Over sin and death and hell. 

I will sing of my Redeemer
And His heavenly love to me;
He from death to life hath brought me,
Son of God, with Him to be.
