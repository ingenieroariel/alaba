Join All The Glorious Names

Join all the glorious names,
Of wisdom love and power;
That ever mortals knew,
That angels ever bore.
All are too mean to speak His worth,
Too mean to set my Savior forth. 

Great prophet of my God,
My tongue would bless Thy name;
By Thee the joyful news,
Of our salvation came;
The joyful news of sins forgiven,
Of hell subdued and peace with heaven. 

Jesus, my great High Priest,
Offered His blood and died;
My guilty conscience seeks
No sacrifice beside;
His powerful blood did once atone,
And now it pleads before the throne. 

My Savior and my Lord,
My Conqueror and my King;
Thy scepter and Thy sword,
Thy reigning grace I sing;
Thine is the power behold I sit,
In willing bonds beneath Thy feet. 

Now let my soul arise
And tread the tempter down;
My Captain leads me forth,
To conquest and a crown;
A feeble saint shall win the day,
Though death and hell obstruct the way. 

Should all the hosts of death
And powers of hell unknown
Put their most dreadful forms
Of rage and malice on,
I shall be safe for Christ displays,
Superior power and guardian grace.
