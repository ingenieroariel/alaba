Jesus Is Tenderly Calling

Calling today, calling today,
Jesus is calling,
Is tenderly calling today. 

Jesus is tenderly calling thee home
Calling today, calling today.
Why from the sunshine
Of love wilt thou roam
Farther and farther away? 

Jesus is calling the weary to rest
Calling today, calling today.
Bring Him your burden
And you shall be blest;
He will not turn you away. 

Jesus is waiting; O come to Him now
Waiting today waiting today.
Come with your sins; at His feet lowly bow,
Come and no longer delay. 

Jesus is pleading; O list to His voice
Hear Him today, hear Him today.
They who believe on His name shall rejoice.
Quickly arise and away.
