Ring The Bells Of Heaven

Glory! Glory! How the angels sing!
Glory! Glory! How the loud harps ring!
'Tis the ransomed army, like a mighty sea,
Pealing forth the anthem of the free. 

Ring the bells of heaven!
There is joy today,
For a soul returning from the wild!
See the Father meets Him out upon the way,
Welcoming His weary wand'ring child. 

Ring the bells of heaven!
There is joy today,
For the wand'rer now is reconciled.
Yes a soul is rescued from His sinful way,
And is born anew a ransomed child. 

Ring the bells of heaven!
Spread the feast today!
Angels swell the glad triumphant strain!
Tell the joyful tidings;
Bear it far away!
For a precious soul is born again.
