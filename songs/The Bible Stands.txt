The Bible Stands

The Bible stands tho' the hills may tumble,
It will firmly stand when the earth shall crumble.
I will plant my feet on its firm foundation,
For the Bible stands, the Bible stands. 

The Bible stands like a rock undaunted,
Mid the raging storms of time.
Its pages burn with the truth eternal,
And they glow with a light sublime. 

The Bible stands like a mountain towering,
Far above the works of man.
Its truth by none ever was refuted,
And destroy it they never can. 

The Bible stands, and it will forever,
When the world has passed away.
By inspiration it has been given,
All its precepts I will obey. 

The Bible stands every test we give it,
For its Author is divine.
By grace alone I expect to live it,
And to prove it and make it mine.
