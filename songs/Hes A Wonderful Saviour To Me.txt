He's A Wonderful Saviour To Me

For He's a wonderful Savior to me,
He's a wonderful Savior to me.
I was lost in sin,
But Jesus took me in.
He's a wonderful Savior to me. 

I was lost in sin,
But Jesus rescued me.
He's a wonderful Savior to me.
I was bound by fear,
But Jesus set me free.
He's a wonderful Savior to me. 

He's a friend so true,
So patient and so kind.
He's wonderful Savior to me,
Ev'rything I need in Him I always find.
He's a wonderful Savior to me. 

He is always near,
To comfort and to cheer.
He's a wonderful Savior to me,
He forgives my sin,
He dries my ev'ry tear,
He's a wonderful Savior to me. 

Dearer grows the love
Of Jesus day by day,
He's a wonderful Savior to me,
Sweeter is His grace,
While pressing on my way.
He's a wonderful Savior to me.
