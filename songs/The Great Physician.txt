The Great Physician

Sweetest note in seraph song,
Sweetest name on mortal tongue,
Sweetest carol ever sung,
Jesus, blessed Jesus. 

The great Physician now is near,
The sympathizing Jesus.
He speaks the drooping heart to cheer.
O hear the voice of Jesus! 

Your many sins are all forgiven,
O hear the voice of Jesus!
Go on your way,
In peace to heaven,
And wear a crown with Jesus. 

All glory to the dying Lamb,
I now believe in Jesus.
I love the blessed Savior's name;
I love the name of Jesus. 

And when to that bright world above
We rise to be with Jesus,
We'll sing around the throne of love
His name, the name of Jesus. 

His name dispels my guilt and fear,
No other name but Jesus;
O how my soul delights to hear
The precious name of Jesus.
