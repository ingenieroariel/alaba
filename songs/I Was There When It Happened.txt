I Was There When It Happened

I was there when it happened,
And I ought to know,
His Spirit burning in me,
Set my heart aglow,
So I praise the Lord today. 

You ask me how I know that Jesus saves me,
How I know that all my sins are white as snow.
You ask me how I know that He forgave me,
Now listen I must tell you how I know. 

You ask me how I know that He redeemed me,
And how I received the peace no gold can buy.
How from the guilt and pow'r of sin He saved me,
Made me an heir to mansions in the sky. 

And now as thru the world I go rejoicing,
I am telling what a Savior dwells within.
How I plunged into the cleansing crimson fountain,
And Jesus washed my soul from ev'ry sin.
