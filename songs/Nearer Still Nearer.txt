Nearer Still Nearer

Nearer, still nearer
Close to Thy heart,
Draw me, my Savior
So precious Thou art!
Fold me oh fold me
To Thy breast,
Shelter me safe
In that "Haven of Rest";
Shelter me safe
In that "Haven of Rest." 

Nearer, still nearer
Nothing I bring,
Naught as an offering
To Jesus, my King;
Only my sinful,
Now contrite heart.
Grant me the cleansing
Thy blood doth impart,
Grant me the cleansing
Thy blood doth impart. 

Nearer, still nearer
While life shall last,
Till safe in glory
My anchor is cast;
Through endless ages ever to be,
Nearer, my Savior
Still nearer to Thee,
Nearer my Savior
Still nearer to Thee. 

Nearer, still nearer
Lord to be Thine!
Sin with its follies
I gladly resign,
All of its pleasures,
Pomp and its pride.
Give me but Jesus
My Lord crucified;
Give me but Jesus
My Lord crucified.
