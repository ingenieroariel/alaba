Hallelujah What A Savior

Man of Sorrows! What a name
For the Son of God who came;
Ruined sinners to reclaim,
Hallelujah! What a Savior! 

Bearing shame and scoffing rude,
In my place condemned He stood;
Sealed my pardon with His blood,
Hallelujah! What a Savior! 

Guilty vile and helpless we,
Spotless Lamb of God was He;
Full atonement can it be,
Hallelujah! What a Savior! 

Lifted up was He to die,
"It is finished!" was His cry;
Now in heaven, exalted high,
Hallelujah! What a Savior! 

When He comes, our glorious King,
All His ransomed home to bring;
Then anew this song we'll sing,
Hallelujah! What a Savior!
