Love Divine

Love so divine, love so sublime,
Love that is deeper than any sean;
Love for us all, oh, how can it be! 

It was love that sent a Savior
To this world of sin and woe,
It was love that left Heaven's portals,
And came down to dwell below;
It was love that stilled the waters
On the stormy Galilee;
It was love that paid sin's ransom,
One dark day on Calvary. 

It was love that heard my pleadings
When I cried out in my sin;
It was love that gave me comfort;
It was love that took me in;
It was love that whispered softly,
"I will never cast you out,"
It was love that eased my heartache;
It was love removed my doubt. 

It is love that still is knocking
At the hearts of sinful men;
It is love that never tires,
But that knocks and knocks again;
It is love that solves all problems
In this world of care and strife;
It is love, the love Jesus,
That gives hope, and peace and life.
