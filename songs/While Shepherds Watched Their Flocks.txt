While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks

While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
All seated on the ground,
The angel of the Lord came down,
And glory shone around. 

"Be not afraid," the angel said,
For fear had seized their mind;
"Glad tidings of great joy I bring
To you and all mankind. 

"To you, in David's town town this day
Is born of David's line
A Savior, who is Christ the Lord;
And this shall be the sign: 

"The heavenly Babe you there shall find
To human view displayed,
In simple clothing, tightly wrapped,
And in a manger laid." 

Thus spoke the seraph, and at once
Appeared a shining throng
Of angels praising God, who thus
Addressed their joyful song: 

"All glory be to God on high
And on the earth be peace;
Good will hence forth from heaven to men
Begin and never cease."
