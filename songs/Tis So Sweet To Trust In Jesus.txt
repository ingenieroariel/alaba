Tis So Sweet To Trust In Jesus

Jesus, Jesus how I trust Him!
How I've proved Him o'er and o'er!
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
O for grace to trust Him more! 

'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just to take Him at His word;
Just to rest upon His promise;
Just to know "Thus saith the Lord." 

O how sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just to trust His cleansing blood;
Just in simple faith to plunge me,
Neath the healing, cleansing flood! 

Yes, 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just from sin and self to cease;
Just from Jesus simply taking
Life and rest and joy and peace. 

I'm so glad I learned to trust Thee,
Precious Jesus, Savior friend;
And I know that Thou art with me,
Wilt be with me to the end.
