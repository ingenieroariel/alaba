My Burdens Rolled Away

Rolled away, rolled away,
I am happy since my burdens rolled away.
Rolled away, rolled away,
I am happy since my burdens rolled away. 

I Remember when my burdens rolled away;
I had carried them for years, night and day.
When I sought the blessed Lord
And I took Him at His word,
Then at once all my burdens rolled away. 

I remember when my burdens rolled away,
That I feared would never leave night or day,
Jesus showed to me the loss,
So I left them at the Cross;
I was glad when my burdens rolled away. 

I remember when my burdens rolled away,
That had hindered me for years,
Night and day.
As I sought the throne of grace,
Just a glimpse of Jesus' face,
And I knew that my burdens
Could not stay. 

I am singing
Since my burdens rolled away;
There's a song within my heart
Night and day.
I am living for my King,
And with joy I shout and sing,
Hallelujah!
All my burdens rolled away!
