O Holy Night

Fall on your knees!
Oh hear the angel voices!
Oh night divine!
Oh night when Christ was born,
Oh night divine!
Oh night, oh night divine! 

O holy night!
The stars are brightly shining;
It is the night
Of the dear Savior's birth.
Long lay the world
In sin and error pining;
Till He appeared
And the soul felt its worth.
A thrill of hope,
The weary world rejoices;
For yonder breaks,
A new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees, 

Led by the light
Of faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts
By His cradle we stand.
So led by light
Of a star sweetly gleaming,
Here came the wise men
From orient land.
The King of kings
Lay thus in lowly manger,
In all our trials
Born to be our Friend;
He knows our need
To our weakness is no stranger.
Behold your King
Before Him lowly bend;
Behold your King
Before Him lowly bend! 

Truly He taught us
To love one another,
His law is love
And His gospel is peace;
Chains shall He break
For the slave is our brother,
And in His name
All oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy
In grateful chorus raise we,
Let all within us
Praise His holy name.
Christ is the Lord
O praise His name forever.
His power and glory evermore proclaim;
His power and glory evermore proclaim.
