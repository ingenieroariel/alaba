Thou Didst Leave Thy Throne

O come to my heart, Lord Jesus.
There is room in my heart for Thee.  

My heart shall rejoice, Lord Jesus,
When Thou comest and callest for me. 

Thou didst leave Thy throne
And Thy kingly crown,
When Thou camest to earth for me.
But in Bethlehem's home
Was there found no room
For Thy holy nativity. 

Heaven's arches rang,
When the angels sang,
Proclaiming Thy royal decree;
But of lowly birth,
Didst Thou come to earth
And in great humility. 

The foxes found rest
And the birds their nest,
In the shade of the forest tree;
But Thy couch was the sod,
O Thou Son of God,
In the deserts of Galilee. 

Thou camest, O Lord,
With the living word,
That should set Thy people free;
But with mocking scorn
And with crown of thorn,
They bore Thee to Calvary. 

When the heaven's shall ring
And the angels sing,
At Thy coming to victory;
Let Thy voice call me home,
Saying, "Yet there is room,
There is room at My side for thee."
