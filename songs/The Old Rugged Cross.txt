The Old Rugged Cross

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown. 

On a hill far away
Stood an old rugged cross;
The emblem of suffering and shame.
And I love that old cross
Where the dearest and best,
For a world of lost sinners was slain. 

Oh, that old rugged cross,
So despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God,
Left His glory above,
To bear it to dark Calvary. 

In the old rugged cross,
Stained with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see;
For 'twas on that old cross,
Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me. 

To the old rugged cross
I will ever be true,
It's shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He'll call me some day
To my home far away,
Where His glory forever I'll share.
