Wonderful Peace

Peace, Peace, wonderful peace,
Coming down from the Father above.
Sweep over my spirit forever, I pray,
In fathomless billows of love. 

Far away in the depths
Of my spirit tonight
Rolls a melody sweeter than psalm;
In celestial-like strains
It unceasingly falls
O'er my soul like an infinite calm. 

What a treasure I have
In this wonderful peace,
Buried deep in the heart of my soul,
So secure that no power can mine it away
While the years of eternity roll. 

I am resting tonight
In this wonderful peace,
Resting sweetly in Jesus' control.
For I'm kept from all danger
By night and by day,
And His glory is flooding my soul. 

And me-thinks when I rise
To that city of peace,
Where the Author of peace I shall see,
That one strain of the song
Which the ransomed will sing
In that heavenly kingdom shall be: 

Ah soul, are you here
Without comfort or rest,
Marching down the rough pathway of time?
Make Jesus your friend
Ere the shadows grow dark.
Oh accept this sweet peace so sublime.
