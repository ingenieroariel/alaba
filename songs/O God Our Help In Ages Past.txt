O God Our Help In Ages Past

O God, our Help in ages past,
Our Hope for years to come,
Our Shelter from the stormy blast,
And our eternal Home! 

Under the shadow of Thy throne
Still may we dwell secure;
Sufficient is Thine arm alone,
And our defense is sure. 

Before the hills in order stood,
Or earth received her frame,
From everlasting Thou art God,
To endless years the same. 

O God, our Help in ages past,
Our Hope for years to come,
Be Thou my Guide while life shall last,
And our eternal Home. 

A thousand ages in Thy sight,
Are like and evening gone;
Short as the watch that ends the night,
Before the rising sun. 

Time like an ever rolling stream,
Bears all its sons away;
They fly, forgotten, as a dream
Die at the op'ning day.
