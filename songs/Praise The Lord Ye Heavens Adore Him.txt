Praise The Lord Ye Heavens Adore Him

Praise the Lord! ye heav'ns, adore Him;
Praise Him, angels, in the height;
Sun and moon, rejoice before Him;
Praise Him, all ye stars of light.
Praise the Lord! for He hath spoken.
Worlds His mighty voice obeyed;
Laws which never shall be broken
For their guidance He hath made. 

Praise the Lord! For He is glorious;
Never shall His promise fail;
God hath made His saints victorious;
Sin and death shall not prevail.
Praise the God of our salvation!
Hosts on high, His power proclaim;
Heaven, and earth and all creation,
Laud and magnify His name. 

Worship, honor, glory, blessing,
Lord, we offer unto Thee;
Young and old, Thy praise expressing,
In glad homage bend the knee;
All the saints in heaven adore Thee;
We would bow before Thy throne.
As Thine angels serve before Thee,
So on earth Thy will be done.
