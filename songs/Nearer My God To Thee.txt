Nearer My God To Thee

Nearer, my God, to Thee;
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee! 

Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee,
E'en though it be a cross
That raiseth me!
Still all my song shall be, 

Though like the wanderer,
The sun gone down,
Darkness be over me,
My rest a stone;
Yet in my dreams I'd be, 

There let the way appear,
Steps unto heaven;
All that Thou sendest me,
In mercy given;
Angels to beckon me, 

Then, with my waking thoughts
Bright with Thy praise,
Out of my stony griefs
Bethel I'll raise,
So by my woes to be, 

Or if, on joyful wing
Cleaving the sky,
Sun, moon, and stars forgot,
Upward I fly,
Still all my song shall be,
